- `Both A and B`
- The boot record on the disk was deleted
- The boot record on the disk has become corrupt

- Lower
- Less reliable
- `Higher`

9. In disk performance, which measure indicates the amount of time it takes for a sector to move under the read/write head?

- Access time
- Seek time
- Spin speed
- `Latency`

10. In order for a computer to know where data goes, each device is assigned an internal address. This address is called what?

    - ATA
    - RAID
    - IDE
    - `SCSI`
