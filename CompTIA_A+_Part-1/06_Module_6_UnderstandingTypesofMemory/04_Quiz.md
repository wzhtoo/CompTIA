1. In random access memory, the lower the number of nanoseconds the better the what?

- Storage capacity
- Port throughput
- ROM interaction
- `Performance`

2. rue or False: VRAM can be read from and written to at the same time.

- `True`
- False

3. What does a parity error indicate about the memory?

- Non-parity memory checking must be run
- The memory is too small
- An error has been corrected
- `There is an issue with the integrity of the data`

4. Dual in-line memory modules (DIMMS) hold memory chips that are connected to the motherboard through pins. How many DIMMs are required to fill a bank?

- Four
- Three
- `One`
- Two

5. True or False: Power-On Self-Test is stored in the ROM memory.

- `True`
- False

6. DRAM is the most popular memory. How does DRAM request a block of data?

- Address row
- `Address row and column`
- Address link
- Address column

7. Which type of random-access memory requires that the information stored within it be constantly refreshed?

- SRAM
- CMOS RAM
- `DRAM`
- VRAM

8. Erasable programmable ROM (EEPROM) called flash ROM runs software from the manufacturer. It is used to update what?

- Processing speed
- RAM
- Hardware configurations
- `BIOS`

9. Software that is written to a read-only memory chip is called **\_\_\_**.

- `Firmware`
- Double-sided memory
- POST software
- EPROM

10. True or False: Non-parity memory is used to perform error checking against the information that is "read" compared to what is "retrieved".

- `True`
- False
