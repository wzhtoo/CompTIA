- Motherboard slots
- Proprietary standards
- `Form factors`

2. True or False: SATA is a technology that allows you to connect hard drives to the system. It has a direct connection to the motherboard which does NOT support hot swapping technology.

   - True
   - `False`

3. Technicians need to know the operations and configurations of the motherboard and components. When installing processor chips, how is a chip installed in a "zero insertion force" (ZIF) socket?

   - `Pull up on the insertion lever`
   - Utilize needle nose pliers and twist counter clockwise
   - Insert the chip through the USB port
   - Chips installed in a ZIF socket must be replaced by the manufacturer

4. Within the motherboard chip set there are two chips which comprise the largest part of the motherboard; these are the North and South bridges. The North Bridge is responsible for communication with which of the following?

   - CPU to PCI
   - CPU to IDE
   - `CPU to memory`
   - CPU to USB

5. Michael is a new IT professional in your shop. He is troubleshooting a laptop and finds he needs to enter the date and time every time the system boots up. He asked you what you think the problem may be. How do you reply?

   - `RS-232`
   - RS-485
   - MIL-188
   - Current Loop

10. Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) is a computer bus used for attaching hardware devices in a computer. How many megahertz do PCI adapters run at?

    - 64 MHZ
    - `33 MHZ`
    - 94 MHZ
    - 98 MHZ
