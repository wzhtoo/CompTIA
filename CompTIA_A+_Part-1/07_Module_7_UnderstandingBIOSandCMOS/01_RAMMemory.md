# BIOS and CMOS: What's the Difference?

### The Basic Input-Output System (BIOS)

- BIOS stands for **Basic Input-Output System**.
- It is a type of firmware embedded on the motherboard of a computer.
- The primary function of BIOS is to:
  - Initialize and test hardware components during the startup process (POST - Power-On Self-Test).
  - Provide the operating system with a basic interface to interact with hardware.
  - Load the bootloader or operating system from storage devices.
- BIOS settings allow users to configure hardware parameters like boot priority, enabling/disabling peripherals, and setting system clock speeds.

### The Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS)

- CMOS stands for **Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor**.
- It refers to a technology used for building integrated circuits and the small memory chip that stores BIOS configuration settings.
- The CMOS chip retains information like:
  - System time and date.
  - Hardware settings (e.g., hard drive configuration, boot order, and power management settings).
- CMOS requires a small battery (commonly called the CMOS battery) to retain its settings when the computer is powered off.

### Key Differences Between BIOS and CMOS

1. **Function**:
   - **BIOS**: Provides the software interface to initialize and manage hardware.
   - **CMOS**: Stores BIOS configuration settings and other system information.
2. **Power Dependency**:
   - **BIOS**: Does not require power to retain firmware; it is stored permanently on a ROM chip.
   - **CMOS**: Requires a battery to retain its data when the system is powered off.
3. **Storage**:
   - **BIOS**: Contains the instructions for system startup and hardware initialization.
   - **CMOS**: Stores user-configurable system settings like time and hardware configuration.

### Conclusion

While BIOS and CMOS work closely together, they serve distinct purposes. BIOS acts as the systemâ€™s initialization software, while CMOS holds configuration data required during startup. Both are crucial for a computer's boot process.
