# Lesson Summary

## Below you will find the summary of the key content covered during the module:

- The process of transmitting electronic data over long distances is known as telecommunications. Voice phone calls, data, text, pictures, and video are all examples of different types of information.
- The three technologies needed for communication through the network are (1) transmission, (2), switching, and (3) signaling.
- The ordinary home telephone receives the electrical power that it needs for operation from the local exchange via two copper wires. This subscriber line, which carries speech signals as well, is a twisted pair called a local loop.
- An international telephone connection from any telephone to any other telephone is made possible by the unique identification of each subscriber socket in the world.
- In telecommunications systems, the transmission of information may be unidirectional or bidirectional.
- The unidirectional systems that transmit in one direction only are called simplex, and the bidirectional systems that are able to transmit in both directions are called duplex systems.
- The transmitted signal (the alteration of voltage or current) consists of multiple frequencies. The range of frequencies is called the bandwidth of the signal.
- Along the long-distance communication connection or channel, the power of the signal is reduced and amplified over and over again.
- In radio transmission, we have to transfer the spectrum of the message into the radio-frequency band for transmission. For this, we use continuous or carrier wave (CW) modulation.
- There exists a definite relation among the peak value, average value, and RMS value of an alternating quantity. The relationship is expressed by two factors, namely; the form factor and the peak factor.
- Coding is a digital symbol processing operation in which the digital form of the information is changed for improved communication.
- The transmission power of the BSs and MSs (telephones) is managed to be as low as possible. This low-power transmission has no adverse effects on other cells that are using the same frequency as this cell.
- The five most essential factors whenever we discuss network-based communication: The sender, receiver, mode of communication, the intended recipient, and a set of guidelines known as protocols.
- The network and switching subsystem (NSS), the base station subsystem (BSS), and the operations subsystem (OSS), which regulate the operation of the NSS and the BSS, make up the GSM network.
- Base stations (BTS, base transceiver station) and base station controllers (BSC), which manage the BTSs, as well as the transcoder/rate adapter unit (TRAU), make up the BSS.
- A subscriber is uniquely identified by their TMSI in addition to their present geographic location. It has a maximum bit size of 4 Ã— 8 bits.
- The Internet and mobile phones were the two main sectors that experienced rapid growth. At the start of the 1990s, the majority of telecom industry specialists did not anticipate this kind of expansion.
