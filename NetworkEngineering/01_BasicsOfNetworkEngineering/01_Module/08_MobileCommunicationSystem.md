## Mobile Communication System

### Cordless telephones

Cordless phones were originally developed for the residential market and they were designed to cover only one local area such as a house and garden. They support only local mobility and should not be considered competitors for cellular mobile networks.

### Radio Paging

Paging systems are simple systems and they transmit short texts or simply generate an audible beep Pagers are small and inexpensive wireless communication devices that are used by subscribers to receive messages without disturbing their current activities. There are two basic types of radio paging networks, on-site pagers, and wide-area pagers. On-site pagers cover a local area like a building or a hospital. Wide-area pagers may cover a whole country.

### Global System for Mobile communications (GSM)

GSM is the Global System for Mobile communications, a standard for networking mobile devices such as mobile telephones.
GSM operates at the 900-MHz frequency band and it became the most widely used second-generation cellular technology. In GSM the subscription information is stored on a smart card and a subscriber can change his or her mobile telephone at any time. When he or she inserts his or her card into the new telephone, he or she has access to exactly the same service as previously. The access method used in GSM is Time-division multiple access (TDMA) in which each frequency channel is divided into time slots for multiple users.

### Code-division multiple access (CDMA)

Code-division multiple access (CDMA) is a channel access method used by various radio communication technologies. CDMA is an example of multiple access, where several transmitters can send information simultaneously over a single communication channel.

The main difference between CDMA and other technologies discussed previously is that on the radio path, it does not use either Frequency-division multiple access(FDMA) or Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA). Instead, mobiles use the wide frequency band all of the time with the help of a unique code for each user. This unique code is used to spread the signal over a wide frequency band and to detect the wanted signal at the receiving end.

### Wireless Local-Area Network (WLAN)

It would be advantageous to have short-range, high-data-rate wireless data transmission available at many workplaces. Hospitals, manufacturing facilities, retail establishments, and convention centers are a few examples. It is necessary to use a method akin to a wired private LAN, and that method is a WLAN.

Access points (APs) are the base stations of WLAN networks, and they are wired to Ethernet. Actually, WLANs are intended to function as wireless extensions to Ethernet's wired backbone.

### Bluetooth

With the use of Bluetooth technology, a common short-haul radio link can take the place of proprietary cords that link one digital device to another. Bluetooth radios can be integrated into mobile computers, cell phones, printers, keyboards, and many more gadgets.

A personal area network (PAN) is a compact wireless Bluetooth network that connects devices like a user's PC and peripherals (PAN). One or more piconets are present in PAN. A Bluetooth piconet can have up to seven active slaves and one master. Slaves are polled by the master, who instructs them to transmit in turn. Bluetooth specifies a synchronous channel for voice applications that sends data between a master and a slave at a constant bidirectional bit rate of 64 kbps.
